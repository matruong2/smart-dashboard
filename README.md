# Smart Dashboard

This project presents a smart dashboard showing the percentages of the population in each census tract without a high school diploma. This smart dashboard updates in real-time to only show the census tracts on the user's screen, so as the user navigates the map to zoom in and out, only the census tracts on the screen will count for the data displayed on the chart. I have chosen to make a proportional symbol map to display the percentages to represent the percentage of people without a high school diploma because the data is separated by census tracts so I thought it would make sense to visualize it with points.
